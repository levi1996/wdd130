    <h2>Levi Guzman</h2>  
    <p>Hi guys! as you see above, my name is Levi and my major is CIT, this is my first semester 
        in college and my first time in the US, so there have been a lot of new things going on in my life. 
        I'm happily married with a beautiful girl since June 2021, it's just my wife and I for now (No babies).</p>   
    <p>I have really high expectactions about this course, I really want to get the most out of it, especially 
        because I want to be able to build a nice website for my future business. I'm very passionated for computer 
        building proccess and I've been dreaming about owning a company that will let you customize and build your own computer.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church for 11 years now, it's been amazing, and I'm grateful for being part of the 
        restored gospel because it brings me joy and hope for the future. I served a full time mission in the 
        Dominican Republic, in the Santo Domingo East Mission from 2014-2016. My favorite quote is from President 
        Thomas S. Monson in a talk titled "Choices" from the General Conference of April 2016, the quote says "The path we 
        follow in this life leads to our destination in the next life". </p>
